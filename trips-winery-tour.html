<h2>Route</h2>
<p>After crossing the Channel and arriving at Le Touquet, clear customs and fill the tank - adventure awaits! 
The trip begins with aerial views of magnificent châteaus as we head down the coast of France towards the D-day beaches of great historic significance, all of which are individually marked in the Helipaddy database. Lunch in a Michelin-starred restaurant is followed by a quick refuel, then a trip down over the famed Le Mans race track. Landing in the Loire at the Château de Cheman, it’s time to indulge in some of the finest gastronomic offerings of the River Loire, with wine tastings and a number of nearby restaurants to choose from.  
Sunday morning sees you take an easterly bearing, towards the various châteaus of the Burgundy region. After a morning of stunning aerial sights it’s time for lunch in a former Benedictine monastery, before a leisurely afternoon ﬂight over the champagne region that sees you return to Le Touquet and depart for England.  Everyone has been to Paris - very few can say they’ve had a weekend   in France anything like this!

<h2 class="medium-top-padding">Destination Guide</h2>
<h3><strong>Le Touquet</strong></h3>
<p>The first port of call for many pilots going across the channel as you can cross the sea at the narrowest point. If you have time to leave the airfield bicycles are available to hire from the terminal and the town is only a ten minute bike ride. If pressed on time and hungry for a snack, the L'Escale Restaurant is just next door to the terminal.
</p>
<h3><strong>Château de Rambures</strong></h3>
<p>Construction on this château began during the Hundred Years War in the style of a military fortress of the 15th century and was one of the first castles in Europe to be constructed almost exclusively in bricks - a defensive measure against the artillery of the time. The castle is set in a dry moat and park, and has been classified as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture since 1927.
</p>
<h3><strong>Château dÉu</strong></h3>
<p>A former royal residence, built in the 16th century to replace an earlier one purposely demolished in 1475 to prevent its capture by the English. The chapel contains the tombs of Henry I, Duke of Guise, and his wife, Catherine de Clèves, who embarked on the construction of the château in 1578. The building was completed almost a century later. Between 1830 and 1848, the château served as King Louis-Philippe's summer residence.

<h3><strong>Mulberry Harbour and the D-day Beaches</strong></h3>
<p>The ‘D-day’ landing site for the Allied invasion of Normandy during World War II, this 50mile stretch of coastline is divided into five sections and includes the ‘Mulberry Harbour’ at Arromanches. A turning point in WWII, the area still bears the remnants of coastal defensive structures and artificial harbours.
</p>
<h3><strong>Château de Sully</strong></h3>
<p>A beautiful Michelin-starred restaurant very close to the D-day Beaches and a great place to land for lunch.
</p>
<h3><strong>Circuit de la Sarthe</strong></h3>
<p>The Circuit des 24 Heures, also known as Circuit de la Sarthe, is a semi-permanent race course most famous as the venue for the 24 Hours of Le Mans auto race. The track uses local roads that remain open to the public most of the year. The circuit, in its present configuration, is 13.629 kilometres (8.47 mi) long, making it one of the longest circuits in the world. Capacity of the race stadium is 100,000.

<h3><strong>Château De Cheman</strong></h3>
<p>Set on the Loire, this château has a quiet, peaceful atmosphere with wine-tasting available and restaurants nearby. It is our accommodation for the night.
</p>
<h3><strong>Château de Saint-Point</strong></h3>
<p>An interesting castle built in the middle ages that was once owned by   the poet Alphonse de Lamartine.
</p>
<h3><strong>Château de Sercy</strong></h3>
<p>Yet another interesting château, built in the 12th century. It has endured a spotted history, including sacking during the French Revolution, fires, and various centuries of abandonment.

<h3><strong>River Thames - <em>Tower of London</em></strong></h3>
<p>Her Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress is a historic castle located on the north bank of the River Thames. The castle was used as a prison from 1100 until 1952, although that was not its primary purpose. A grand palace early in its history, it served as a royal residence, and has a dark reputation as the place high-profile prisoners were held before execution, including Anne Boleyn and Guy Fawkes. As a whole, the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat.
</p>
<h3><strong>Château de Pierre-de-Bresse</strong></h3>
<p>A historical monument, this stunning 17th century château of the Burgundy region is set in picturesque gardens and is a must-see aerial point of interest.
</p>
<h3><strong>Château de Gilly</strong></h3>
<p>Originally a Benedictine Priory and at one stage owned by Cistercian monks, this hotel and restaurant with a magnificent 14th century gothic dining room is a beautiful place for a lunch stop.

<h3><strong>Laon Chambry</strong></h3>
<p>A heli-friendly recreational aerobatics airfield to refuel at before returning to customs at Le Touquet.
</p>
<h3><strong>Château de Pierrefonds</strong></h3>
<p>A seemingly Disney-esque castle, the Château de Pierrefonds includes most of the characteristics of defensive military architecture from the Middle Ages, though it underwent a major restoration in the 19th century.
